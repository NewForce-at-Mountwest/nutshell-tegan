However, Friday night will see a partly cloudy sky with scattered showers and thunderstorms redeveloping as lows fall to near 70 degrees.  On Saturday, the day starts with some clouds and lingering showers, mainly south and east. More sunshine can be expected for the afternoon for most locations, but areas near and especially in the mountains will see a re-firing of scattered showers and storms. High temperatures will not be quite as hot on Saturday but will still be on the warm side, rising to the low to mid 80s.  Sunday and Monday will see lots of sunshine with highs back in the low 90s.
